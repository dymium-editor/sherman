    /// on position. So the equality should be transitive if the ordering of slices isn't changed:
    /// if `x.try_join(y)` succeeds but `y.try_join(z)` doesn't, then `x.try_join(y).try_join(z)`

/// Directional-arithmetic counterpart to [`std::ops::Add`]
///
/// This trait goes alongside [`DirectionalSub`] as supertraits of [`Index`]. The explainer on what
/// directional arithmetic *actually* is, and why we have it.
///
/// A blanket implementation is provided for all `T: Add<Output = Self>`, so **you do not need to
/// interact with this trait if you are not writing a custom index type**. That said, this
/// documentation is equally provided for the merely curious.
///
/// ## Directional arithmetic -- Motivation
///
/// First off, it's worth addressing why we've gone to all these lengths to have "directional
/// arithmetic" in the first place -- why couldn't the plain `Add` and `Sub` traits have worked?
///
/// Well, one of the abilities we *needed* to have when designing this crate was to be able to use
/// two-dimensional indexes -- e.g., line & column number. It turns out these are really tricky to
/// fit into a one-dimensional system, particularly because any single index for 2D values won't
/// have commutative addition/subtraction. But it *is* possible with some restrictions, and much of
/// the weird pieces of design in this crate are essentially required in order to enable this
/// functionality.
///
/// Thankfully for you, dear reader, any [`Index`] type for line/column pairs works as an effective
/// approximation of the minimal set of guarantees provided by an [`Index`] type, so we'll tend to
/// use that in the explanations here -- either implicitly (illustrations of ranges) or explicitly
/// (referring to some hypothetical file, with line/column pairs as points within it).
///
/// ---
///
/// The first key thing to notice about [`Index`] types is that they *also* represent the offset
/// between two points -- this is required internally for [`RleTree`], but also implicit in the API
/// of [`Slice`]. If we were just looking at integers, we might've assumed that this was part of
/// indexes without second thought, but 2D index types require careful consideration.
///
/// The essence of it is that offsets between 2D index types only *really* make sense when used
/// between the original locations. This is basically what directional arithmetic provides --
/// operations where the original positions of the values are explicit in the function. In the
/// documentation for each of the arithmetic operations, there are diagrams showing the
/// relationship between the ranges of the inputs and outputs.
///
/// It's precisely the need for operations to use the original locations that requires directional
/// arithmetic. Addition can have a default implementation (as `add_left` already does), but
/// there's no way to represent either `sub_left` or `sub_right` in terms of any of the other
/// operations.
///
/// ## Directional Arithmetic -- Precise semantics
///
//
// TODO: There's some work that could be done here to clarify the relationship between indexes and
// ranges. The essential idea is that indexes are offsets, and offsets are attched to unique
// ranges, so operations on indexes require that the ranges line up right.
//
///
/// This section gets a little bit notation-heavy. This is only really intended to be used if
/// you're testing the implementation of some [`Index`] type to make sure that it upholds the
/// necessary properties. The general idea here is that indexes are only valid when used with
/// something from their original range, so any implementation that operates within those bounds
/// should be ok. The expected behavior of addition and subtraction *mostly* follows from the idea
/// of operations on ranges.
///
/// When we say "original range", really what we're talking about is that -- conceptually -- the
/// ranges at the borders of a range must remain the same. So if we know that `x.add_right(y)` is
/// valid, `x.add_right(y.add_right(z))` must also be, but `x.add_right(z.add_right(y))` might not.
/// Expressed visually:
///
/// ```text
/// |--- x.add_right(y) --|  (ok)
/// |---- x ----|--- y ---|
///
/// |- x.add_right(y.add_right(z)) -|  (ok)
///             |-- y.add_right(z) -|
/// |---- x ----|--- y ---|--- z ---|
///
/// |- x.add_right(z.add_right(y)) -|  (not ok, out of order)
///             |-- z.add_right(y) -|
/// |---- x ----|--- z ---|--- y ---|
/// ```
///
/// In the final case, the result is undefined -- implementors can return whatever value they like,
/// or panic (though you must not trigger UB). It is the caller's (i.e. *our*) responsibility to
/// ensure that invalid operations are never attempted.
///
/// The above property is a bit difficult to formalize, so I haven't attempted to here -- it is my hope
/// that the description as is should be clear *enough*. If there are any doubts, feel free to
/// reach out.
///
/// ---
///
/// The remaining properties are all equalities. They can get a bit dense, so we'll introduce some
/// notation to help out: we'll write `add_right` as `+>`, `add_left` as `<+`, `sub_right` as `->`,
/// and `sub_left` as `<-`. The properties are then:
///
///  * Commutativity: `x +> y == y <+ x`
///  * Associativity: `(x +> y) +> z == x +> (y +> z)`
///  * Subtraction as the inverse of addition: `(x +> y) -> y == x == (x <+ z) <- z` and
///    `(x -> y) +> y == x == (x <- z) <+ z`
///  * Idempotency of zero: if `Self: Zero`, then `x +> 0 == x == x <+ 0` and
///    `x -> 0 == x == x <- 0`
///
/// We also have distributivity over subtraction, which is each of the following six equalities:
///
///  * `x -> (y <+ z) == (x -> y) -> z`
///  * `x <- (y +> z) == (x <- y) <- z`
///
///  * `x -> (y -> z) == (x +> z) -> y`
///  * `x <- (y <- z) == (x <+ z) <- y`
///
///  * `x -> (y <- z) == (x -> y) +> z`
///  * `x <- (y -> z) == (x <- y) <+ z`
///
/// All of the above properties are expected to be *logically* valid over an infinite-ish range in
/// either direction (i.e., including negative numbers), but may *in practice* fail to produce
/// values outside of a certain range (e.g., above a maximum value, or below zero). This allows us
/// to still reason about [`Index`]es using negative numbers without requring that the types
/// themselves be signed.
///
/// The justification for most of the properties should hopefully make sense, but distributivity
/// can be particularly hard to visualize. If you are interested, the source for this trait
/// contains detailed ASCII-art illustrations to provide some justification for the rules above.
///
/// [`RleTree`]: crate::RleTree
